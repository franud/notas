- The first real virus that propagated itself over the internet
- It created a copy of itself in other computers over the internet
- Created to demonstrate the possibility of a self-replicating computer program that could spread to other computers. 
- Did not make any damage, it only writed:
> I'm the creeper, catch me if you can

- Accepted to be the first computer [[Worm]]
- To remove this virus, it was created the first nematode called Reaper, witch pretty much worked like Creeper but instead of just writing to a terminal, it removed the virus.
